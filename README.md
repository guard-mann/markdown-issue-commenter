# Markdown-to-Issue Commenter

Post markdown files as comments to GitHub Issues via GitHub Actions.  
Useful for collaborative discussions, AI-generated logs, review notes, and documentation-driven workflows.

---

## Features

- Write comments in markdown files (e.g., `docs/issue_updates/1.md`)
- Automatically post them to GitHub Issue of corresponding No. (e.g. issue #1) via GitHub Actions
- Fully Git-tracked: keep comment history with commits
- No need to open the GitHub UI manually â€” just `git push`

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or use this template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guard-mann/markdown-issue-commenter.git
cd markdown-issue-commenter
```

### 2. Add a markdown file under docs/issue_updates/:
```markdown
// docs/issue_updates/1.md
This is an auto-posted comment for Issue #1.
```
### 3. Push your changes:
```bash
git add docs/issue_updates/1.md
git commit -m "Add comment for issue #1"
git push
```

The comment will be posted automatically to Issue #1.

## Demo

Example file is on `docs/issue_updates/1.md` and on `Issues` tab (issue #1):
```markdown
# this is a test
Comment on the md is reflected to the corresponding No. issue.
```
